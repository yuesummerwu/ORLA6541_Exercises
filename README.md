# Overview 

This repository stores the exercises for a data science course offered at Teachers College, Columbia University. The course is taught by Dr. Alex J. Bowers and is usually held in the Fall semester. The author took this cause in Fall 2024, finishing all these exercises with her teammates, Karlie Meng and Maeghan Sill.

All these exercises utilzied open-access data, and the author tried to directly call datasets from the website so all codes can be run without downloading any datasets to local computer. The only exceptional case was the use of `pisa` dataset, which was called from the author's laptop. However, this dataset is openlly accessible through a link offered by Bulut & Desjardins (2021) in their book. 

# Topics Covered 

There were five required exercises in total, covering the following topics: 
1. basic usage of R,
2. data visualization,
3. hiarachical cluser analysis (HCA) and heatmaps,
4. receiver operating characteristic (ROC),
5. classification and regression trees (CART),
6. topic modeling. 

# File Formats 

All exercises were done using R Studio and the codes were written in Rmarkdown. For better preview on Github, a markdoown version for each exercise was also offered. However, Especially, some references were added using R-built-in functions, so they might not have been rendered in those markdown files, sp I recommended viewing the html file for the best readability, which can be found below.

# Exercise Contents 

Each exercise was designed by Dr. Bowers for practicing different data science topics. You can find what contents were covered and the datasets used in each exercise in the following table. 

| Exercise | Topics | Datasets | References |
|----------|----------|----------|----------| 
| Exercise 1  | Basic Usage of R; Data Visualization  | `nycflights13`; `pisa`  |-| 
| Exercise 2  | Basic Usage of R; Data Visualization | `nycflights13`; `pisa`   |
| Exercise 3  | HCA; Heatmap  | `mrcars`  |
| Exercise 4  | ROC AUC; CART | `ELS:02`; `pisa`  |
| Exercise 5  | Topic Modeling | `IMBd`  |

# Comments 

The author and her teammates were all biginners in Data Science. Though most of the work were replications, there were some data cleaning decisions made by ourselves. Therefore, there must be some mistakes or oversights in the markdowns. Please feel free to contac me if you find anything surprising, confusing, or concerning.
