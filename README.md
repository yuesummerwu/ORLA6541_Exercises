# Overview 

This repository stores the exercises for a data science course offered at Teachers College, Columbia University. The course is taught by Dr. Alex J. Bowers and is usually held in the Fall semester. The author took this cause in Fall 2024, finishing all these exercises with her teammates, Karlie Meng and Maeghan Sill.

All these exercises utilzied open-access data, and the author tried to directly call datasets from the website so all codes can be run without downloading any datasets to local computer. The only exceptional case was the use of `pisa` dataset, which was called from the author's laptop. However, this dataset is openlly accessible through a link offered by Bulut & Desjardins (2021) in their book.
