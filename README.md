# Course Exercises from ORLA 6541: Applied Data Science in Organizations and Leadership üìù

This repository contains exercises from a data science course offered at Teachers College, Columbia University. The course, taught by Dr. Alex J. Bowers, is typically held in the Fall semester. The author completed these exercises in Fall 2024 alongside her teammates, Karlie Meng and Maeghan Sill.

All exercises utilized open-access data. To ensure reproducibility, the author directly accessed datasets from their respective websites, allowing the code to run without requiring prior downloads. The only exception was the PISA dataset, which was accessed from the author's laptop. However, this dataset is publicly available through a link provided in the book by Bulut & Desjardins (2021).

## Topics Covered üñáÔ∏è

There were five required exercises in total, covering the following topics:

1. Basic usage of R
2. Data visualization
3. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)
4. Heatmaps 
5. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
6. Area under the curve (AUC)
7. Classification and regression trees (CART)
8. Topic modeling

These exercises provided a comprehensive foundation in data science techniques, focusing on both practical applications and theoretical understanding.

## File Formats üìÅ

All exercises were completed using RStudio, with the code written in RMarkdown. For better previewing on GitHub, a Markdown version of each exercise is also provided. However, some references were generated using R's built-in functions and may not render correctly in the Markdown files. For the best readability and full functionality, it is recommended to view the corresponding HTML files, which can be found below.

## Comments üîà

The author and her teammates were beginners in Data Science. While most of the work involved replications, some data cleaning decisions were made independently. As a result, there may be mistakes or oversights in the provided Markdown files. If you come across anything surprising, confusing, or concerning, please feel free to contact me. Your feedback is greatly appreciated! üòä
